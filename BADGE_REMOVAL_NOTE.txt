                    EMERGENT BADGE INFORMATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The "Made with Emergent" badge is currently showing on your website.

WHY IT'S SHOWING:
The badge is added by Emergent's platform and is designed to be 
persistent. This is part of Emergent's free tier service.

WHEN IT WILL BE REMOVED:
✓ The badge will be automatically removed when you deploy your website
  to production using Emergent's deployment system
✓ It only shows during development/testing phase
✓ Your live production website will NOT have this badge

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
1. Continue development - the badge won't show on the live site
2. Focus on completing your website features
3. When ready to show clients, deploy to production
4. The production URL will be clean without any badges

PRODUCTION URL FORMAT:
After deployment: https://your-app-name.emergent.host

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NOTE: For now, you can show clients your salon website and explain that
the badge is only visible during development. The final website they 
receive will be completely clean and professional.
